# Cyber-Security-Capstone-Project-
AI-Powered Phishing Detection — A cybersecurity capstone project developing a machine-learning-based proof-of-concept system to detect phishing emails through feature engineering and classification models, with a phased roadmap toward operational deployment.

## Project Overview
This repository contains Group 6’s Cyber Security Capstone (INFO36206) project focused on designing and validating an AI-powered phishing detection system. The project explores how machine learning techniques can improve phishing email detection beyond traditional rule-based filtering approaches.
The system analyzes email content and structural indicators to classify emails as phishing or legitimate, emphasizing interpretability, evaluation rigor, and real-world applicability.

## Objectives
- Develop a proof-of-concept phishing detection model using supervised machine learning
- Perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Establish a phased roadmap from offline feasibility testing to API-integrated deployment

## Phase 1 — Proof of Concept
Phase 1 focuses on validating feasibility using offline, publicly available datasets:
- Dataset acquisition via APIs or public repositories
- Data cleaning, normalization, and label verification
- Feature extraction (e.g., keywords, URLs, email length, sender indicators)
- Baseline model training and tuning (e.g., KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
- Performance evaluation and documentation

## Phase 2 — Planned Expansion
Phase 2 extends the system toward operational readiness:
- Email ingestion via inbox APIs
- Enhanced feature extraction (metadata, headers, reputation data)
- Advanced ML / NLP techniques
- Near-real-time classification
